# The Main Idea:

Adding ultrasonic sensor and Bluetooth module for the robotic arm task (previous task). 

The ultrasonic for sensing objects if there is in front of the robot or not.
And the Bluetooth for communicate with the tablet wirelessly

# Components:

1. Arduino 
2. Servo motors x6
3. Battery
4. Capacitors x2
5. Voltage regulator 
6. Ultra sonic sensor
7. HC 05 Bluetooth module

## Ultrasonic Sensor connection pins

### Notes:

1. The degrees are based on imagination so they can be easily adjusted based on simple math after designing the arms by the mechanical engineer. 

# Code:

I present only the important new codes instead of all code.

1. Libraries 

2. Defning:

3. Setup:

4. The main body (points):

### Note:

1. Since there is no bluetooth module in tinkercad so the code did not test, so it may occur small errors can be adjusted easily.

# Important notes:

1. There is no bluetooth module in tinkercad that why i did not record a video.
